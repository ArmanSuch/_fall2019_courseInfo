# Homework 8: Drawing 3 (with conditionals)

### 1 Conditionals

Conditionals let us make a program responsive. Sometimes it's responding
to something the user does. Sometimes it's responding to something
happening in the program, such as an object running into the edge of the
window.

### 2 Task

Use the graphics library provided by the textbook (you'll find it in your
repository) to create something graphical that responds to user input. 

### 3 Hints

 * The graphics library includes methods to wait for the user to click somewhere
(and find out where they clicked), see where they last clicked, and get text
from the window, as well as an entry object that provides text entry
boxes.

 * Notice that this isn't building on the previous assignments (because
 I'm not sure that it will necessarily make sense with your previous
 drawings). This
 is more a proof-of-concept. I'd just like you to get interaction to work
 with conditionals. Artistic application of conditionals is bonus.
