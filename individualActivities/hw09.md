# Homework 9: Drawing 4 (with iteration)

*This builds on Homework 7. You should do it first.*

### 1 Iteration

Iteration lets us do something a certain number of times or until
something happens. 

### 2 Task

Edit your drawing from homework 7 (or 8, if you built on 7 in 8).
Incorporate iteration into your drawing. You can *refactor* a
pre-existing repetative portion of your drawing or add something
new.

### 3 Hints

 * If you want to do something a certain number of times, use a
 ```for``` loop. Most programming languages let you provide
 the loop directly with a number and way of counting. Python
 is different. It presumes that you are iterating through
 what it calls (drum roll please...) an iterable. Iterables
 are things like lists and dictionaries. We haven't introduced
 these yet in class, so you'll want to use the built-in 
 ```range``` function to set the number of iterations.

 * If you want to do something until something happens, use a
 ```while``` loop. While uses the same kind of boolean (true/false)
 logic that we used in conditionals.
