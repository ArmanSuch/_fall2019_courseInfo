# Homework 3: Convert from Fahrenheit to Celcius


### 1 Overview

The first program someone writes is usually to print "hello world" 
to the screen--you should have done this in class. The second program 
someone writes is usually to convert Fahrenheit to Celcius or vice 
versa. Why? It's probably the simplest useful problem to solve. You
don't need to know anything fancy, just be able to print the result.
It's basically hello world plus math, using variables, etc.

### 2 Task

Convert from Fahrenheit to Celcius. You can hard-code the intiial
fahrenheit value and just print the result.

### 3 Hints

 * Hard code = assign a value to a variable. Good programmers *never*
 write their entire program at once. Hard coding a variable lets you
 write the entire rest of your program without creating a user interface.

 Especially in scientific computing, you might never need a user interface.
 Often you're writing scripts that only need to be used a few times by no
 one who isn't you.


 If you understand the program and have the code, you can
 just type in new values and re-run the program with new values any time you
 want. You only need a user interface if someone who doesn't understand your 
 program needs to use your program, or if you need to use your own program
 often enough that not having one becomes annoying.
